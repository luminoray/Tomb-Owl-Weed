# About

Tomb Owl Weed is an infinite runner game made for the [Godot Wild Jam #20](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-20) using [Godot Engine v3.2.1.stable.official](https://godotengine.org/).

## How to play

Try to get as far as you can without getting stuck! If you get stuck however, it's not the end. As you roll around the desert you can leave behind 5 seeds so another weed can continue from where you left it! Only the last planted seeds count, so if you don't plant seeds with that new weed, you will have to start over!

### Obstacles and Collectibles

* The Cactus is a vertical obstacle you must jump over.
* The Rock can be rolled on, but you will get stuck if approached from the side.
* The Bird will fly over and try to intercept you.
* The Hole contains a Snake that will boost you up and make you jump really high.
* The Seed replenishes your available seeds by one.
* The Owl judges your decision of playing this game, and allows the developer to give the game a punny name.

## Controls

* Z or E - Plant Seed
* X or W - Glide / Fall slower
* C or Space - Jump / Double Jump
